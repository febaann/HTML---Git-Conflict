    <h1>Hello guys welcome to GitHub </h1>
    <h2>Lets study Git Conflicts</h2>
    <p>Version control systems are all about managing contributions between multiple distributed authors ( usually developers ). Sometimes multiple developers may try to edit the same content. If Developer A tries to edit code that Developer B is editing a conflict may occur. To alleviate the occurrence of conflicts developers will work in separate isolated branches. The git merge command's primary responsibility is to combine separate branches and resolve any conflicting edits.</p>
